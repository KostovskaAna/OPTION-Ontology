## OPTION-Ontology ##

OPTION (OPTImization algorithm benchmarking ONtology) is an ontology developed with the primary goal of formalizing knowledge about benchmarking of 
optimization algorithms, emphasizing formal representation of data from the performance and problem landscape space. Thus, OPTION offers a comprehensive description of
the domain covering the benchmarking process and the core entities involved in the process,
such as optimization algorithms, benchmark problems, and evaluation measures. 

OPTION is also available on BioPortal via the [link](https://bioportal.bioontology.org/ontologies/OPTION-ONTOLOGY "link").
